# Wine Classification Project
This project focuses on building machine learning models to classify wine samples into different cultivar classes based on their chemical attributes. Three different classifiers are explored: XGBoost, Support Vector Classification (SVC), and Logistic Regression.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Wine dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains chemical analysis results of wines grown in the same region in Italy but derived from three different cultivars. The dataset has the following attributes:

- Alcohol
- Malic acid
- Ash
- Alcalinity of ash
- Magnesium
- Total phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color intensity
- Hue
- OD280/OD315 of diluted wines
- Proline
- The target variable is the cultivar class (1, 2, 3).
